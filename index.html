      <h2>Info</h2>
      <div id="tribute-info">
        <p>Jun Seba (Japanese: <span style="font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">瀬葉 淳</span>, Hepburn: Seba Jun, February 7, 1974 – February 26, 2010), better known by his stage name Nujabes (<span style="font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">ヌジャベス</span>, Nujabesu), was a Japanese record producer, audio engineer, DJ, composer and arranger best known for his atmospheric instrumental mixes sampling from hip hop, soul, and jazz. </p>
        <p>Nujabes was born in the Nishi-Azabu district of Minato in central Tokyo, Japan. Seba was the owner of two Shibuya record stores, T Records and Guinness Records, and in 1998 founded the independent record label Hydeout Productions.</p>
        <p>His debut album, Metaphorical Music, was released in 2003. Other highlights included his soundtrack work for the anime show Samurai Champloo, spread across a pair of 2004 releases, and 2005's Modal Soul, on which he was joined by Terry Callier for an update of "Ordinary Joe."</p>
        <p>In 2010, at the age of 36, Nujabes died in a traffic accident. The compilation Modal Soul Classics II, as well as productions by Funky DL, Abstrakt Idea, and Ta-Ku, among many other artists, were made in tribute to him. The posthumous Nujabes album Spiritual State was issued in 2011.</p>
